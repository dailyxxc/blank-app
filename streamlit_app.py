    ### 1. Significance
    With the change of lifestyle, the problem of obesity has become increasingly serious. Understanding and mastering the factors affecting obesity, and classifying and predicting the level of obesity, are of great significance for the formulation of obesity prevention and control strategies. This project aims to provide a basis for personalized obesity prevention and intervention through data analysis, helping people better manage their health.

    ### 2. Features
    Our dataset includes multiple features related to eating habits and physical conditions, such as gender, age, height, weight, family history of obesity, frequent consumption of high-calorie foods, daily vegetable intake, number of main meals per day, between-meal eating, smoking status, water intake, daily calorie monitoring status, physical activity frequency, time using electronic devices, alcohol consumption frequency, daily transportation mode, etc. These features have different degrees of correlation with the level of obesity. For example, family history of obesity and frequent consumption of high-calorie foods show a significant positive correlation with the level of obesity, while gender, smoking status, etc., have weaker correlations.

We have built an effective prediction model through a series of steps such as data preprocessing, model selection, and optimization. Users can input relevant data and obtain personalized obesity level prediction results through interaction on the webpage, so as to better understand their health status and take corresponding prevention and intervention measures.
